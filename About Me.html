    <p>
Greetings, traveler! I’m Ellroy Jenkins - web developer by day, raid tank by night, and someone who is just as comfortable battling HTML bugs as I am tanking Onyxia with my guild.

I specialize in building websites that are clean, functional, and (unlike a bad dungeon group) does not break under pressure. Whether it is creating smooth, responsive layouts or bringing creative ideas to life on the web, I love turning digital chaos into order — much like managing a raid group on a Monday night.

My adventure into web development started like many heroic tales: a mix of curiosity, determination, and a whole lot of Googling. Over time, I have leveled up my skills, completed countless side quests (aka passion projects), and honed my craft into something I am truly proud of.

When I’m not writing code, you can usually find me wielding a two-hander and charging into boss fights in World of Warcraft. I raid with my guild regularly, and honestly, it is one of the best crash courses in teamwork, communication, leadership, and occasionally, creative problem-solving when the healer disconnects mid-pull.

Outside of work and raids, I enjoy sleep, reorganizing my desk like it is an inventory screen, and drinking enough coffee to trigger a buff.

I am currently open to new quests — freelance gigs, full-time roles, creative collaborations, or anything that requires a brave soul and a solid internet connection. If you are looking for someone who can build solid web experiences and won’t panic when things aggro unexpectedly, let’s chat.

For the Alliance!    </p>
